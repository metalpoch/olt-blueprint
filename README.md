# üìê Ultra Monitor 
Ultra Monitor is a platform for traffic monitoring and analysis in OLTs (Optical Line Terminals) using SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol). It supports traffic analysis by OLT, port, client, or geographical location.

## üóÇÔ∏è Structure
- **cmd/server/**: Main backend (REST API, authentication, reports, traffic, etc.) in Go.
- **cmd/cli/**: CLI tool for administration, scanning, and technical operations.
- **controller/**, **handler/**, **routes/**, **usecase/**: Shared domain logic, controllers, and routes.
- **client/**: React frontend (coming soon).
- **smart/**: AI module in Python (coming soon).

## ‚öôÔ∏è App workflow

ONT11[(ONT)] --> OLT1[(OLT)]
ONT12[(ONT)] --> OLT1[(OLT)]

ONT2n[(ONT)] --> OLT2[(OLT n)]

OLT1[(OLT)] -- SNMP --> M(Measurement*)

OLT2[(OLT)] -- SNMP --> M(Measurement*)

M --> D[(Database)]
M --> S(Server*) 
M --> R[(Cache)]

D --> S
R --> S
S --> UI(Client)
```

This diagram shows how measurement data from various OLTs is collected and stored in a database, then used to generate traffic and reports, which are accessible to clients through an authentication system.


1.  **OLT (Optical Line Terminal)**:
    -   **OLT's**: Represent different OLTs sending measurement data.
    -   **SNMP Protocol**: Measurement data is transmitted from the OLTs to the measurement node using the SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol).
2.  **Measurement**: Node representing the module that receives and centralizes the measurements sent by the OLTs.
3.  **Database**: Node where the module received measurements are stored for further processing.
4.  **Data Processing**:
    -   **Traffic**: Node representing the module the traffic generated from the stored data.
    -   **Report**: Node representing the module the generation of reports based on the stored data.
    - **Smart**: Node representing the module that processing of intelligent data from stored information.
5.  **Authentication**:
    - **Auth**: Node representing the module that controls access to both the traffic and the reports, ensuring that only authenticated users can access the information.
6.  **Client**:  Node representing the end client who accesses the authenticated data.
